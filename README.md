I used matplotlib figure and axes objects to visualize the dataset(abs) using several visualization techniques such as error bar, boxplot, histplot bar plot etc

## How To Run The Code

To run the code, pip install matplotlib in your terminal or command prompt, after that, copy and paste the code and add the abs file to your project path
