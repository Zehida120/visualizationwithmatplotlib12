I used matplotlib figure and axes methods to visualize the dataset(abs) using several visualization techniques such as error bar, boxplot, histplot bar plot etc. To run the code, pip install matplotlib in your terminal or command prompt, after that, copy and paste the code and add the abs file to your project path
